# Notes


Try to put together a "stand-alone" no-dependency gem for rlp (recursive length prefix).


Try to use the "best" of

- <https://github.com/cryptape/ruby-rlp>    (is standalone but now archived - and may support too much) and
- <https://github.com/q9f/eth.rb>   (- see /rlp  - is simpler but "inline" and not standalone)




Check the issue with the source encoding - ASCII-8BIT required (for BINARY string encodings for constants) - why? why not?
